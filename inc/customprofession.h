//! Manages custom professions independent of a fortress
/*!
CustomProfession objects hold all data needed to map a set of labors onto a
dwarf. A dwarf can either have a default-profession (determined by the game
based on the dwarf's highest skill) or a custom-profession. In DF, custom
professions don't actually have any real meaning other than semantic.

Using Dwarf Therapist, you can associate any number of labors with a custom 
profession and save this association outside of the game. You can then
apply a custom profession to a dwarf with this tool, and it will set the 
appropriate labors on that dwarf.
