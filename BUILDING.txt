Instructions for how to build from source are as follows:

For Windows, download the QTCreator IDE and open the dwarftherapist.pro file.  You can build
from within QTCreator.

For Linux, do the following:

# Install required packages
* qtchooser
* qtbase5-dev
* qtbase5-dev-tools
* qtscript5-dev
* qt5-qmake
* libqt5script5
* libqt5scripttools5
* libqxt-core0 
* libqxt-gui0

For Debian-derived (Ubuntu, Mint, etc.) distributions, you can run the following command from a terminal:

    > sudo apt-get install qtchooser qtbase5-dev qtbase5-dev-tools qtscript5-dev qt5-qmake libqt5script5 libqt5scripttools5 libqxt-core0 libqxt-gui0


# Clone the project using git
Clone the project to wherever you like.  The location doesn't really matter.

For 34.11 and older use the main branch:

    > git clone git://github.com/splintermind/Dwarf-Therapist.git
    
For 40.00 and newer use the DF2014 branch:

    > git clone git://github.com/splintermind/Dwarf-Therapist.git DF2014
    
If you already have the older version checked out and you'd like to move to the new branch:

    > git checkout DF2014
    > git pull
    
    If you receive any errors about uncommitted changes:
    
        > git status # tells you what files have changed
        > git checkout -- # put the listed files between the dashes and hash


# Build the project

    > cd Dwarf-Therapist
    > qmake -qt=5
    > make

This will take some time.  Get a cup of coffee.  Once your build is complete, run

    > sudo make install

If you want, you can now remove the folder you cloned from github.

If your build fails for whatever reason, the easiest way to start over again is to go to wherever you cloned the project and run

    > rm -rf Dwarf-Therapist

and you can restart with cloning the project.

If you are having problems with building, ask on the Splintermind thread in the Bay12Forums.  (http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=122968)


# Run the program
The executable is in your /usr/bin folder and should be run via the dwarftherapist script also in /usr/bin

    > sh dwarftherapist


# Uninstallation

You can remove the program two ways:

Automated: if you still have the folder you cloned from github, run
    > sudo make uninstall
in that directory.

Manually: using sudo rm -rf, remove:

* /usr/bin/X11/dwarftherapist
* /usr/share/dwarftherapist/*
* /usr/share/applications/dwarftherapist.desktop
* /usr/share/doc/dwarftherapist/*
* /usr/share/pixmaps/dwarftherapist.png
* /usr/share/pixmaps/dwarftherapist.xpm
