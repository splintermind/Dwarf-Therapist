========================
BUILDING DWARF THERAPIST
========================

Windows
=======
Download the Qt Creator IDE and open the dwarftherapist.pro project.

You must perform one of the following steps to have DT run properly in Qt Creator. They are listed in approximate order of recommendation:

- Change default build step: Run ``make`` (aka nmake, jom) with arguments ``first install``.
- Set the *run* working directory to ``%{sourceDir}``.
- Disable shadow build.
- Manually copy the ``share`` directory from the clone to the build location, i.e. ``%{buildDir}`` or ``%{buildDir}/<build type>``.

In order to allow DT to run properly *outside* of Qt Creator, add a custom build step: ``<location of Git Bash>`` with argument ``%{sourceDir}\scripts\windeployqt.sh`` running in ``%{buildDir}``.

Linux
=====

Dependencies
------------

Debian-based
************

::
    sudo apt-get install build-essential texlive-latex-recommended texlive-latex-extra # needed always
    sudo apt-get install qt4-qmake libqt4-dev # Qt 4
    sudo apt-get install qt5-qmake qtbase5-dev qtbase5-dev-tools qtdeclarative5-dev # Qt 5

Gentoo-based
************

::

    sudo emerge -av qtcore # Qt 4 (Currently only Qt 4 is supported)

* As Gentoo only supports Qt 4, qmake doesn't have a -qt parameter.
  Otherwise, follow the instructions as below.

Fedora 20+
**********

::

    sudo yum install qt5-qtbase-devel qt5-qtdeclarative-devel

Building
--------

First of all clone splintermind GitHub repository (green button on the right) by downloading ".zip" file. Unzip it to your desired location and for ease of use navigate to it using the Terminal (example: cd ./Downloaded/DF/). We will assume that you will be installing DT in this newly unziped directory. Also you should type console commands without "" sign- did them for the sake of clarity.

Versions of qmake
**********

::

    qmake -qt=4 # Qt 4 on Debian-based
    qmake -qt=5 # Qt 5 on Debian-based
    qmake-qt5   # Qt 5 on Fedora
    qmake # Qt 4 on most other distros
    make -j$(nproc) # Run as many jobs as processing units

For instructions on exactly where to find "qmake" and how to invoke it on other distros, consult your distribution's documentation.

Step 1:
**********

To configure where DT will be installed, pass the "PREFIX" variable, for example :

::
    qmake -qt=5 PREFIX=~/./Downloaded/DF/

You can stick with unziped directory or choose your own.
This will take 2â€“10 minutes, depending on CPU.

Step 2:
**********

Get a cup of coffee.

Once your build is complete, run "make install" or "sudo make install". [Use sudo if you wish to install into the
default /usr/local directory (i.e, if you didn't pass the "PREFIX" variable to
"qmake")]

    make install
    OR
    sudo make install

Troubleshooting
---------------

If your build fails for whatever reason, the easiest way to start over again is to go to wherever you cloned the project and run::

    rm -rf Dwarf-Therapist

and you can restart with cloning the project.

If you are having problems with building, ask on the Splintermind thread in the Bay12Forums: http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=122968.

Uninstallation
--------------

Automatic
*********

If you still have the folder you cloned from github, run::

    sudo make uninstall

in that directory.

Manual
******

Using sudo rm -rf, remove::

* /usr/bin/{dwarftherapist,DwarfTherapist}
