========================
BUILDING DWARF THERAPIST
========================

The following instructions reference Qt 4 and 5; see README.rst for information on the difference.

Windows
=======
Download the Qt Creator IDE and open the dwarftherapist.pro project.

You must perform one of the following steps to have DT run properly in Qt Creator. They are listed in approximate order of recommendation:

- Change default build step: Run ``make`` (aka nmake, jom) with arguments ``first install``.
- Set the *run* working directory to ``%{sourceDir}``.
- Disable shadow build.
- Manually copy the ``share`` directory from the clone to the build location, i.e. ``%{buildDir}`` or ``%{buildDir}/<build type>``.

In order to allow DT to run properly *outside* of Qt Creator, add a custom build step: ``<location of Git Bash>`` with argument ``%{sourceDir}/windeployqt.sh`` running in ``%{buildDir}``.
This automatically copies the correct libraries to the build directory for packaging.

To include debug symbols, select the "Debug" profile.

Linux
=====

Dependencies
------------

Debian-based
************

::

    sudo apt-get install qt4-qmake libqt4-dev # Qt 4
    sudo apt-get install qt5-qmake qtbase5-dev qtbase5-dev-tools qtdeclarative5-dev # Qt 5

Gentoo-based
************

::

    sudo emerge qtscript:4 # Qt 4
    sudo emerge qtdeclarative:5 qtwidgets:5 # Qt 5

Fedora 20+
**********

::

    sudo yum install qt5-qtbase-devel qt5-qtdeclarative-devel

Building
--------

::

    qmake -qt=4 # Qt 4 on Debian-based
    qmake -qt=5 # Qt 5 on Debian-based
    qmake-qt5   # Qt 5 on Fedora
    qmake # Qt 4 on most other distros
    make -j$(nproc) # Run as many jobs as processing units

For instructions on exactly where to find qmake and how to invoke it on other distros, consult your distribution's documentation.

This will take 2â€“10 minutes, depending on CPU.
Get a cup of coffee.

To include debug symbols (if you have a crash), add "debug" to the end of the make command (before the #).

Once your build is complete, run::

    sudo make install

If you want, you can now remove the folder you cloned from github.

Troubleshooting
---------------

If your build fails for whatever reason, the easiest way to start over again is to go to wherever you cloned the project and run::

    rm -rf Dwarf-Therapist

and you can restart with cloning the project.

If you are having problems with building, ask on the Splintermind thread in the Bay12Forums: http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=122968.

Uninstallation
--------------

Automatic
*********

If you still have the folder you cloned from github, run::

    sudo make uninstall

in that directory.

Manual
******

Using sudo rm -rf, remove::

* /usr/bin/{dwarftherapist,DwarfTherapist}
* /usr/share/dwarftherapist/
* /usr/share/applications/dwarftherapist.desktop
* /usr/share/doc/dwarftherapist/
* /usr/share/pixmaps/dwarftherapist.*
